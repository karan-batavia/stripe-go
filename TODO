# Documentation TODO

- interval_count transformation
- Price can be mapped to two objects: order line and pricebook
- Override will cause metadata to be added to stripe
- Timezone handling. All date strings are converted into midnight UTC unix timestamp values.
- price being mapped to two unique objects (order line & pricebook)
- SOQL query status conditionally not being a hard requirement
- You cannot modify line item data in SF after it's been activated. This information will not be picked up.
- Sub lines with different start dates is not supported
- Custom record metadata key is slightly different for key size saving
- Document zero quantity items (they are removed? Need to double check)
- Document no >1 quantity metered billing items
- Days until due: allows integers, only support defaults, must setup not set by default. Cannot support float.
- if a customer has more than 3 subscriptions on a customer, they will get an error (maybe this just applies to test clocks?)
- Phase is not mapped on the initial order, mapped on each order amendment
- Prices which are not created directly from pricebooks (i.e. from order lines, or duplicated because of the one-price-per-subscription) are archived (active = false) after they are used
- Some good test clock docs https://groups.google.com/a/stripe.com/g/cloudflare/c/VjNW1Q4KD-0
- fyi if the filter is changed we don't retroactively pick up orders. the orders have to be updated in some fashion (just updating a note/description will do just fine) for it to be reprocessed
- On a backend prorated order amendment the same metadata is used as the initial order
- Tiered prices cannot be prorated

Apex / checks:

- we'll want any errorLogger entries to be sent to sentry as well
- I'm not seeing the order type defined here. Did you create an order amendment in CPQ and ensure the same field structure is used here?
