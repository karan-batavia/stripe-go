# Documentation TODO

- interval_count transformation
- Price can be mapped to two objects: order line and pricebook
- Override will cause metadata to be added to stripe
- Timezone handling. All date strings are converted into midnight UTC unix timestamp values.
- we need to document this: the price is mapped to two unique objects

Next:

- Think through prorations
- Separate order processing into a separate job
- Separate redis connection for locker
- Implement amendment logic
- resque pool
- KMS

Future:

- web server timeout for 30s heroku? https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server#timeout
- maybe preload database connections here? https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-rails-applications-with-the-puma-web-server
- https://github.com/fohte/rubocop-daemon

Apex / checks:

- we'll want any errorLogger entries to be sent to sentry as well
- I'm not seeing the order type defined here. Did you create an order amendment in CPQ and ensure the same field structure is used here?
