# Development

## Processes

`foreman start` will run all necessary processes with one command, or you can start them individually via `foreman run web`.

## Rubocop Daemon

- Strip out the logic which checks for where rubocop is located and add `bundle exec` to the command prefix
- Start daemon in a separate terminal (`bundle exec rubocop-daemon start`)
