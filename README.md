# Stripe Systems

- Sentry errors: https://sentry.corp.stripe.com/organizations/stripe/issues/?project=610
- Papertrail: https://my.papertrailapp.com/groups/16772762/events
  - Throw Stripe IDs or Salesforce IDs in the search to see a papertrail for them
  - Order ID from Salesforce are best

# Dev Snippets

Loud logging everywhere:

```ruby
Stripe.log_level = 'debug'; Restforce.log = true; ENV['LOG_LEVEL'] = 'debug'
```

Or, via shell:

```shell
STRIPE_LOG=debug SALESFORCE_LOG=true LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG bundle exec ruby test/...
```

Include debugging tools locally. This is done automatically in dev, but you need to manually do this in the prod console.

```ruby
require_relative './test/support/salesforce_debugging.rb'; include StripeForce::Constants; include SalesforceDebugging
```

Pull user reference. Helpful for console debugging:

```ruby
@user = user = u = StripeForce::User[90]
```

Want to get a friendly dump of the values?

```ruby
pp user.values
```

Or via a search:

```ruby
@user = user = u = StripeForce::User.where(Sequel.ilike(:salesforce_instance_url, "%the_search_string%")).first
```

Or by account ID. Be warned! There are multiple account IDs, some 15 char & some 18 char. We store the 18 char.

```ruby
@user = user = u = StripeForce::User.find(salesforce_account_id: 'account_sf_id'.strip)
```

You get the idea!

Perform translation:

```ruby
StripeForce::Translate.perform_inline(u, 'the_salesforce_id'.strip)
```

[Here's a walkthrough video on this topic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eOsbY52bLnRTaKQ-tcORb7X17MILq0nJ/view?usp=sharing). Perform translation on queue in order to get logging in papertrail:

```ruby
SalesforceTranslateRecordJob.work(u, 'sf_order_id'.strip)
```

Check SQL generated:

```ruby
locker = Integrations::Locker.new(user)
poller = StripeForce::OrderPoller.new(user)
poller.send(:generate_soql, DateTime.parse('2022-06-13 12:36:59 +0000'), DateTime.parse('2022-06-13 12:41:29'))
locker.clear_locked_resources
```

Get all of the users in prod:

```ruby
StripeForce::User.dataset.extension(:pretty_table).print(:id, :email, :salesforce_account_id, :salesforce_instance_url)
```

Get all of the poll timestamps:

```ruby
StripeForce::PollTimestamp.dataset.extension(:pretty_table).print
```

# PR Review Conventions

Here are some of the 'tags' that PR comments will be prefixed with to provide more context:

- no tag: requested change that requires either an explanation or fix
- `fyi` sharing some sort of domain or product knowledge that may be helpful
- `nit` non-blocking style or small change
- `followup` something to definitely implement in the future
- `future` something to consider in the future
- `curious`
- `suggestion`
- `issue`

# SalesForce

## Permission assignments

In order for the ruby service to update Stripe ID fields, it needs to have the right permissions. Here are the two permissions required:

- "Stripe Connector Integration User" permission set
- Update Activated Orders

In the org, go to setup>permission sets> stripe connector integration user> manage assignments>add assignments and check your user in the org > then click assign.

## Clearing Our Test Data

Here's how to manually clear our test data. This may be fixed with `SBQQ.TriggerControl.disable()` in the delete script, can remove this later if this is the case!

```shell
sfdx force:org:open -u platform-integrations-bots+cpqqapackage@stripe.com -p "/lightning/setup/ImportedPackage/home" > /dev/null
sfdx force:org:open -u mbianco+standardcpq@stripe.com -p "/lightning/setup/ImportedPackage/home" > /dev/null

# disable apex triggers

sfdx/bin/sfdx-wipe-account platform-integrations-bots+cpqqapackage@stripe.com
sfdx/bin/sfdx-wipe-account mbianco+standardcpq@stripe.com
```

## Creating a stratch org

- Specify your dev hub via `sfdx force:config:set --defaultdevusername`. This can be any salesforce dev org.
- Then use `sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a cool-alias -d 30` to create a stratch org. Lasts for a max of 30d.
  `alias sf=sfdx` is going to make your CLI-life easier.

Apex triggers run synchronously, TODO add to notes

## Finding an existing package

Here's how to find the URL of the latest package we have:

- Login to the packaging org (we have QA & Prod)
- Setup > Package Manager > Click on package name
- Versions > click on version number
- "Installation URL" is what you are looking for. The ID on the end can be used via SFDX.

Here's the shell command to install a package:

```shell
sfdx force:package:install --upgradetype DELETE -p 04t5f000000aSFv
```

Each version of a package has a unique URL.

## Production Package Deployment

[Here's a video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ok4Gl2rBJwy3w4AieeIa9PkWLxyK_4rP/view?usp=sharing)

The below script will guide you through rolling a new Prod package, as well as auto-tag main with the environment and version number (ie 'prod-1.79.0'):

```shell
./sfdx/bin/roll-new-package -e prod
```

The script will prompt you to roll a new package, follow the steps below to do so.

- Click on the name of the package
- Copy the package name field (`stripeConnector`), you'll need it in the next step
- Click on upload, then:
  - Release Type > Managed Released
  - Version Name: `QaStripeConnect`
  - New version number will be determined automatically
  - New Order Save Behavior: unchecked (this should be done by default)
  - Do not worry about description or release notes

Some notes:

- globalGuidGenerator should not be included in the production package
- If you are adding new apex classes, JS code, remote sites, etc you need to click "add" and MANUALLY go through each category of items that you are adding and add them individually.
- You can automatically add stuff to a package, but it is not recommended since it is very to add items you don't want, which is hard to debug (and remove!)
- Removing something from a package is very hard. You need to (a) open up a case with SF and get them to switch the package to beta (b) deploy the latest version of the source (c) we remove the component.
  - Partner Community cases: "View My Cases". We need to provide the reason we are reverting back to beta. Although we need to remove the actual components.
- If something is causing an error that you deleted in your source code, you can edit the offending file to resolve whatever is causing the error. This is often easier than asking SF to move your package to beta.
- Ensure the "old order save behavior" is NOT checked

### Production Package Release

Manual steps that need to be taken for the release to be verified by Salesforce:

- https://security.secure.force.com/security/tools/forcecom/scanner use username and password of the production packaging org.
  - Report will probably land here https://groups.google.com/a/stripe.com/g/pbo/c/XoQHgHYjRzI
- Submit something to the partner community (details in the video)
- Include sec rev in the username of another account which contains the latest production package.
- Make sure to write the Release Notes

### Production Package Testing

- We only wish to test the currently deployed production package. Therefore we do NOT run the salesforce tests like we do in QA, this is because those tests involve pushing a new source install.
- If you accidentally run these tests against production, you must follow the below steps to clean up the prod test account:

  - `sfdx force:source:delete -p force-app/main/default/ --apiversion=54.0 -u brennen+prodtest@stripe.com`
  - If you are running into issues, try deleting the conflicts via the salesforce UI or via SFDX but specify down the path to just the problematic files.
  - Some records may need to be manually altered:
    - Go to the [Lightning App Builder](https://productiontest2-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/FlexiPageList/page?address=%2F_ui%2Fflexipage%2Fui%2FFlexiPageFilterListPage) and select the 'Sync Record Record Page' that lacks a Namespace Prefix and has an 'Edit' button. Click edit and then 'Activation' in the top right hand corner. Under 'Org Default' click 'Remove as Org Default' and select both Desktop and Phone. Then click Save.

- If you are running into permission errors related to Orders, you are most likely missing the standard CPQ setup permissions that a real account would have. We have some permission sets created for us in the force-app/main/scratchSetup folder. If you are creating a new testing environment you will have to deploy this folder and assign the permissions to your test user.

  - ie: `sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/scratchSetup -u brennen+prodtest@stripe.com` followed by `sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n "Order_Permissions" -u brennen`+prodtest@stripe.com
  - Right now, OrderPermissions is the only permission set we have defined but there may be additional ones in the future.

- If you are seeing Order upsert failures like "Can't save order products with negative quantities: Quantity"
  - Check the following boxes on this page: `sfdx force:org:open -u brennen+prodtest@stripe.com -p "/lightning/setup/OrderSettings/home"`
    - Enable Negative Quantity
    - Enable Zero Quantity

## Creating a new QA package

[Here's the full guide to creating a new package](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.packagingGuide.meta/packagingGuide/uploading_packages.htm).

The below script will guide you through rolling a new QA package, as well as auto-tag main with the environment and version number (ie 'qa-1.79.0'):

```shell
./sfdx/bin/roll-new-package -e qa
```

The script will prompt you to roll a new package, follow the steps below to do so:

- Click on the name of the package
- Copy the package name field, you'll need it in the next step
- Click on upload, then:
  - Release Type > Managed Released
  - Version Name: `QaStripeConnect`
  - New version number will be determined automatically
  - New Order Save Behavior: unchecked (this should be done by default)

After rolling, make sure to install it on the package org test account (distinct from the packaging org, which is used to generate the package):

https://appiphony92-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/

**Warning:** the QA package is automatically updated on each CI build, so it is possible that CI runs the deploy command _right_ after your deploy command finishes running, which could cause strange issues where QA includes a WIP branch.

**Note:** Everytime you upload a package you'll see a "Are you sure?" message letting you know you can't edit components. Ignore it.

## Removing Components from QA or Production Packages

As referenced above, it is a slightly convoluted process to remove a component from a package once it has been added. You must:

- Log into the partner community (https://help.salesforce.com/)
- Make sure you select technical support from the options drop down when creating a new case
- Provide them the org ID, package name and version number you would like rolled back to Beta.
- They will prompt you to do so but you can pre-emptively grant Salesforce Support access via:
  - Click your name -> My settings -> Personal -> Grant Account Login Access
  - Set the access duration for Salesforce.com Support to 1 Week
  - Click Save

For deleting objects, you may need to remove all the dependencies first by making a shell of the component and then deploying that.

- Example commit here: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-salesforce/commit/f

To delete lightning web components, you must delete them from the Lightning Components Page

- https://appiphonycom7-dev-ed.lightning.force.com/lightning/setup/LightningComponentBundles/home

## Manually Creating Global Key Metadata

This needs to be done when you are installing the source and not the package:

- Setup > Custom Metadata Types
- Setup Connection Data > Manage Records > New
- Label: Default, Global Key: $SF_MANAGED_PACKAGE_API_KEY

## Creating Salesforce Metadata

- List all metadata within the account `sfdx force:mdapi:listmetadata -m CustomMetadata -u dev`
- Get field information on a metadata record:
  - `sfdx force:schema:sobject:describe -s Setup_Connection_Data__mdt -u dev | jq '.fields[] | [.name,.label,.type]'`
  - `sfdx force:schema:sobject:describe -s Setup_Connection_Data__mdt -u dev | jq '.fields | map(.name)'`
- Get the metadata value `sfdx force:data:soql:query -q "SELECT Id, Label, Global_Key__c FROM Setup_Connection_Data__mdt" -u dev`
- `sfdx force:cmdt:record:create --typename Setup_Connection_Data__mdt --recordname SetupConnectionData API_Key__c="" Global_Key__c="$SF_MANAGED_PACKAGE_API_KEY" Salesforce_Connected__c="" Stripe_Connected__c="" --protected=true`
- setup> custom metadata types> Stripe Connection Data > new and enter ‘Default’ for the label and developer name and add the key and save

## Platform OAuth Tokens

- The Billing PBO Salesforce org holds our connected application
- Setup > App Manager > Stripe Connector > Edit to change scopes or add additional valid callback URLs
- Same flow with a 'view' action to view consumer tokens

## Batch Service Example

```
http -vvv POST https://appiphony15-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/apexrest/batchApi 'Authorization: OAuth TOKEN' 'order_ids:=["8015f000000UNriAAG"]'
```

`TOKEN` and domain can be pulled from `.env` after refreshing tokens locally:

```
bundle exec ruby scripts/refresh-tokens.rb mbianco+biancodevorg@stripe.com
```

## Disable MFA (email code verification) on test accounts

Note this _should_ be handled automatically by `scratchSetup/settings/Security` when your scratch org is setup. You may need to deploy these settings on non-scratch orgs.

Disable Multi Factor Authentication (aka mfa, 2fa, email code verification):

- Setup > Session Settings > Session Security Levels
- remove Multi Factor Authentication

There a google plugin called Whitelist All IPs for Salesforce that our contractors use. Install that plugin and go to Setup, switch to Classic, then go to Network Access and there should be a Whitelist All IPs button that you click and will allow anyone to log in without having sent an email verification code.

## Connecting to a different org

TODO this may not be applicable anymore since we've removed the `.sfdx` folder from source control:

- `sfdx/sfdx-project.json` edit the `sfdcLoginUrl` to match the URL you are logging in against
- `sfdx/.sfdx/sfdx-config.json` edit the `defaultdevhubusername` / `defaultusername` TODO confirm if this is needed
- `sf alias:set standardcpq=mbianco+standardcpq@stripe.com` adds an entry to `~/.sfdx/alias.json`

## Resetting Salesforce Org Keys

- Debug console
- Anon Apex
- maintenanceUtilities.resetServiceConnection();

# Development

## Ruby Code Deployment

We have a pipline setup in heroku. You first push to the canary, and then promote it to the rest of the pipeline. Canary is still production, but is just a single worker so you can push your changes up to recieve a minor fraction of traffic for a time when integrating large changes / features.

```
# on first setup
git remote add canary https://git.heroku.com/stripe-force-canary.git (push)

# when you are on main and ready to deploy:

# Pushes to canary worker
git push stripe-force-canary origin/main:main

# Pushes to rest of production workers
heroku pipelines:promote -r stripe-force-canary
```

## Helpful Scripts

Checkout `scripts/` and `bin/` for helpful scripts to aid development.

## API

```shell
http POST https://salesforce.suitesync.io/v1/post-install Salesforce-Account-Id:00D5e000003V0C7EAK Salesforce-Key:ORGANIZATION_KEY key=123123

http PUT https://salesforce.suitesync.io/v1/configuration field_defaults:='{"subscription_schedule":{"STRIPE_FIELD_2":"value"}}' field_mappings:='{}' Salesforce-Account-Id:00D5e000003V0C7EAK Salesforce-Key:THE_KEY

http https://salesforce.suitesync.io/v1/configuration Salesforce-Account-Id:00D5e000003V0C7EAK Salesforce-Key:THE_KEY
```

## Processes

`foreman start` will run all necessary processes with one command, or you can start them individually via `foreman run web`.

## Rubocop Daemon

- Strip out the logic which checks for where rubocop is located and add `bundle exec` to the command prefix
- Start daemon in a separate terminal (`bundle exec rubocop-daemon start`)

## Typechecking / Sorbet

Want to reference a local copy?

```shell
export SRB_SORBET_TYPED_REPO="/Users/mbianco/Projects/sorbet-typed"
export SRB_SORBET_TYPED_REVISION="mbianco/rails-fixes"
```

# Debugging

Install all gems locally to easily grep through them:

```shell
BUNDLE_DISABLE_SHARED_GEMS=1 BUNDLE_PATH=vendor/bundle bundle
```

# Tests

## Ruby

- Before running tests, you'll need a valid oauth token: `bundle exec ruby scripts/refresh-tokens.rb`
  - If the above script is not granting you a new access token for your scratch org, you can also generate a new one via `sfdx force:org:open -u brennen-scratch`
  - This will have refreshed your access token for SFDX, so you can re-run the refresh-tokens script above to replace it in your ENV.
- `NO_RESCUE=true bundle exec rails test "test/**/test*.rb"` will run the entire test suite
- `NO_RESCUE=true RAISE_EXCEPTIONS=true bundle exec rails test "test/**/test*.rb"` will run the entire test suite with exception handling like CI
- `NO_RESCUE=1` to avoid autoloading pry-rescue in the test suite

## SFDX

- Run a single test: `sfdx force:apex:test:run --classnames <class_name> -u brennen-scratch --synchronous`
  - ie `sfdx force:apex:test:run --classnames test_updateSyncRecordsStatusesTrigger -u brennen-scratch --synchronous`
  - `--synchronous` will print the results of the tests instead of async execution, and a seperate command to get results.

# Heroku

```
heroku drains:add syslog+tls://logs5.papertrailapp.com:28081
```

After adding to papertrail, you'll need to rename the system to something legible. [More instructions here.](https://papertrailapp.com/systems/setup?type=system&platform=heroku)

- To run ruby arbitrary files on a dyno:
  - Add the file to /bin
  - Deploy to canary
  - `heroku run bash -a stripe-force-canary`
  - `bundle exec ruby bin/<script_file_name.rb>`
