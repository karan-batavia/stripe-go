                    This is a URL formula field that, when clicked, will navigate you to the Stripe record you are currently viewing in Salesforce. You can optionally add it to your Order, Order Product, Account, Opportunity, Product, and Pricebook Entry page layouts.

                <p>
                    The Stripe ID field is used for the integration to match Salesforce records to Stripe records. If you would like to see which records are actively synchronizing with Stripe, you can include it in your Order, Order Product, Account, Opportunity, Product, and Pricebook Entry page layouts. It is recommended that the field is marked as “Read Only” on the page layouts to prevent users from accidentally modifying the values.
